## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/lsj5031/tailslap-lite/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Include a clear description and steps to reproduce
3. Share your environment: Windows version, .NET runtime version, LLM provider used
4. Attach logs from `%APPDATA%\TailSlap\app.log` if relevant

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork and branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Code style**: Follow the conventions in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
   - C# 12 with nullable reference types enabled
   - PascalCase for public members, `_camelCase` for private fields
   - Sealed classes by default
   - No external NuGet dependencies beyond built-in .NET libraries

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Build release version
   dotnet build -c Release
   
   # Publish self-contained single file
   dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true
   ```
   Then run the published exe and verify the feature works

4. **Commit messages**: Clear, concise, present tense
   - `Add clipboard history feature`
   - `Fix hotkey registration on Windows 11`
   - `Improve error messages for invalid LLM config`

5. **Before pushing**:
   - Ensure code compiles without warnings
   - No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or sensitive information
   - Format code consistently (VS Code format recommended)
   - Automated tests will run via GitHub Actions (build.yml)

6. **Submit PR**:
   - Reference related issues: "Fixes #123"
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include any configuration examples if adding new features
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and test your PR
